              Our world is divided into two segments, one that symbolises uncertainity of violence and war and the other which is built on the foundation of hope and belief – A world torn by act of violence around the world, hunger , poverty, injustice, inequality and many more where on the other hand there is a world constantly trying to find a solution for permanent truce. Amidst continuous cry of sarcasm, many international organisation stand up to the case of International Peace and Security because there is a belief that somewhere, anyhow such noble activities can form “A New World A Better World”.

              At Ravenshaw University Model United Nations, we also put forth our believe on such similar case but do not talk about any great men’s word nor we rest our vision on the rules set by our forefathers. We demand to live by our own perception and innovative ideas, struggling yet working towards the fulfillment of our fundamental rights that validates our birth as human beings, and give a cry of initiation to make this world a better place for our future generation. A future free of baseless borders dividing people in the name of religion, ethnicity and caste, a future where every single human sleeps with food in his/her stomach and simle on his/her face, a future where festivals and not bombs light the lives of innocent children, where every country can ask for its share of sovereignty and every citizen can ask for his/her equality.

              At RUMUN, we believe that its not only a conference where students role play various leaders to fight it out with heavy words and vocabulary jargon but to impart a sense responsibility in these young minds and find solutions to problem at hand which can be both pragmatic, innovative and long term. The idea is not only to raise placards but to raise one’s expectations as a leader making him believe that “Yes, a country’s future is now in my hands and whatever course I take in the council will decide it’s fate”. This might sound a bit more intimidating but leading a country of more or less 1 billion is a matter of great power and “with great powers comes greater responsibilities’’.

              With these words, I on behalf of the entire Organising Committee is honoured to welcome and challenge you all into the tricky road of diplomacy where one decision of yours can bring forth a compromise or decimate the entire world.<br> Choice is yours…<br>
              Thank you
